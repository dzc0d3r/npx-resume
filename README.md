## Welcome
Hi there👋👋 My name is Walid Lamraoui (dzc0d3r)
I'm a fullstack web developer 👨‍💻 from Algeria :algeria:
For me programming is more than a hobby or job it's a passion and a reason to get up from bed in the morning :heart: 


### What's this ?
Just a package to share and show my resume right in the terminal as a command by simply runnig:

```
npx walid-resume
```
