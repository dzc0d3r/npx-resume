## Welcome
Hi there👋👋 My name is Walid Lamraoui (dzc0d3r) from Algeria :algeria:
I'm On  an exciting journey to become a fullstack web developer 👨‍💻 
For me programming is more than a hobby or a job ... it's a passion and a reason to get up from bed in the morning :heart: 


### What's this ?
Just a package to share / show my resume right in the terminal as a command by simply running:

```
npx walid-resume
```
